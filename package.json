Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the command `expo build:web` not being found during the build process.

**Solution:**
The error indicates that the `expo` command is not found, which means the Expo CLI is not installed in the environment. To resolve this issue:

1. Add Expo CLI as a devDependency to the project:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev expo-cli
   ```

2. Verify that `expo` is added as a devDependency in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.

By adding Expo CLI as a devDependency and ensuring it is present in the project's dependencies, the `expo build:web` command should be recognized and the build should succeed.
